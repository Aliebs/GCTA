Welcome to generic-crappy-text-adventure.

This is my first "Project", and as such its quality will probably be laughable.
However you have to start from somewhere, so here I go.

GCTA is, as the name implies, a generic text adventure game.
The storyline is basically non-existent, its only real use being to allow for various game mechanics.
It's set in medieval Europe. There will be dragons. That is all I can say.

Game mechanics to be included will be; Health bars, different weapon types, armour, healing items,
evasion chance, random critical hits, different weapon effects (Posion, cold, etc) and lots more!
